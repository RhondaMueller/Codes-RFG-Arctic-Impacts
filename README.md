# Codes - Radiative forcing geoengineering increases Arctic temperature extremes and permafrost thawing

##  File Descriptions
This repository contains code to run the analysis done for this paper:

- The ".gitignore" file ensures that unwanted files that exist within a Git repository are not tracked; e.g., checkpoints for Jupyter notebooks.

- The "environment.yml" file details the packages that are used in the Conda environment that underlies the principal analytical code in this repository.

- The ipynb files are structured according to the figure they provide the output to. The underlying data can be obtained from the references of the paper.

- The .py files are python sub-scripts that are needed for some of the codes to rin (ED Figure 1 and 2 and Figure 3).

This repository and the scripts contained within were created by Rhonda MÃ¼ller (rhonda.mueller (at) uzh.ch).
