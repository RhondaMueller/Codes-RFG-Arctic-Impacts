##  File Descriptions
This repository contains code to run the analysis done for this paper:

- The ".gitignore" file ensures that unwanted files that exist within a Git repository are not tracked; e.g., checkpoints for Jupyter notebooks.

- The "environment.yml" file details the packages that are used in the Conda environment that underlies the principal analytical code in this repository.

- The ipynb files are structured according to the figure they provide the output to. The underlying data can be obtained from the references of the paper.

- Fig_3_Mean_clm.py is a sub-script that is needed for Figure_3 to run.

This repository and the scripts contained within were created by Rhonda MÃ¼ller (rhonda.mueller@uzh.ch)
